# YapIEx

vim-inspired IEx wrapper.

## Development

1. Do magic üõ†Ô∏è
2. Run it with `mix run --no-halt`

Note: ‚ùå It messes up with the IO, hence if you run with `iex -S mix` the YapIEx terminal application appears "on top" of IEx standard prompt.

Also note that if run within an IEx shell (e.g. `iex -S mix` first and then `Ratatouille.run/2`) it has a bad lag and misses key presses.

I haven't noticed this problem if running it without IEx (only `mix run --no-halt`) ü§î
